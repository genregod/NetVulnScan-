# NetVulnScan

NetVulnScan is an advanced, open-source network vulnerability scanner that detects open ports and identifies common vulnerabilities across IP ranges. With newly integrated enhancements, it now offers improved scanning efficiency, resumable scans, progress tracking, and comprehensive output management—all through a user-friendly command-line interface. NetVulnScan is perfect for simplifying network security assessments and maintaining a secure environment.

## **Features**

- **Efficient Active Host Discovery**: Quickly identifies active hosts using surface scans before deep scanning for vulnerabilities.
- **Enhanced Port Scanning**: Supports full port ranges (0-65535) or custom-defined port lists, with improved handling for large port ranges.
- **Chunk-Based Scanning**: Divides port scanning into manageable chunks to handle system limits and avoid errors.
- **Resumable Scans**: Resume interrupted scans seamlessly using cached data.
- **Real-Time Progress Tracking**: Tracks and displays scan progress using a built-in progress bar for better visibility.
- **JSON Output**: Saves scan results in JSON format for further analysis.
- **Custom Error Handling**: Enhanced exception handling for uninterrupted operations.
- **User-Friendly CLI**: Simplifies complex network scanning tasks with a straightforward interface.

## **Installation**

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install python-nmap tqdm
   ```

2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/NetVulnScan.git
   ```

3. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd NetVulnScan
   ```

## **Usage**

Run the following command:
```bash
python enhanced_vuln_scanner.py <target_ip_range> <ports> <output_file> [--resume]
```

### **Positional Arguments**
- `target_ip_range`: The target IP range in CIDR notation (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24).
- `ports`: Comma-separated list of ports (e.g., 21,23,80,443) or a range (e.g., 0-65535) to scan.
- `output_file`: Output file to save the scan results in JSON format (e.g., `scan_results.json`).

### **Optional Arguments**
- `--resume`: Resume the scan from the last checkpoint using cached data.

## **Examples**

1. Scan for specific ports:
   ```bash
   python enhanced_vuln_scanner.py 192.168.1.0/24 21,23,80,443 scan_results.json
   ```
   This will scan the 192.168.1.0/24 subnet for open ports 21, 23, 80, and 443, saving the results to `scan_results.json`.

2. Scan all ports with resumable functionality:
   ```bash
   python enhanced_vuln_scanner.py 192.168.1.0/24 1-65535 full_scan_results.json --resume
   ```
   This will scan all ports in the 192.168.1.0/24 subnet, resuming from cached progress if interrupted.

## **Enhancements**
The following improvements have been made to the original NetVulnScan:
- Integrated active host discovery for quicker and more efficient scans.
- Added resumable scans with progress caching and automatic checkpointing.
- Reduced system constraints by chunking large port ranges.
- Added real-time progress visualization using the `tqdm` library.
- Improved error handling for invalid data and scan interruptions.
- Optimized performance when handling large IP ranges and ports.
